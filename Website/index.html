			<h1>Visible Light Communication</h1>
			<br></br>
			<p>
				In recent years, Visible Light Communication (VLC) has emerged as a complementary technique to overcome limitations of the crowded radio frequency (RF) spectrum. Its superior characteristics include unlicensed wide bandwidth, high security and dual-use nature (Illumination and data). 
				Our prototype transmits data using LEDs and receives the same using a photodetector. To implement this VLC link, we have utilized National Instruments LabVIEW with Ettus USRP (Universal Software Radio Peripheral) N210, and an optical transmitter and photosensitive receiver as a replacement for conventional RF antennas.</p>

							 LEDs (LUW CN5M) transmit binary  data to the receiver photodetector (PDA36A). The intermediate components are Bias Tee (ZX85-12G+) and SMA Cables. USRPs (N210) are used for transmission and reception of data.

			</h2>
			<p>
				This is the set up that we created to demonstrate the data transfer using Visible Light. On the transmitter PC, there is a LabVIEW VI which decodes a sound file, modulates it using Frequency Modulation with a 1 MHz carrier frequency and transmitter gain of 10dB.
				As the USRP is N210, the USRPs and PCs are connected through a local network. <br> The transmitter USRP is connected to the bias tee using an SMA cable. The bias tee converts the bipolar signal generated by the USRP with a 2V DC bias which is provided by the voltage source such that the input to the LED driver is within the linear range of conversion.  The bias tee gives output to the PCB which has ultra white colored LEDs and driver circuit containing MOSFETs.
				<br>
				The receiver hardware is a photo-detector with a trans-impedance amplifier circuit which converts the optical signal back to analog. 
				On PC 2, the LabVIEW VI receives the analog signal and encodes it into a sound file which is played continuously.

			<h1>Impact</h1>
			<br></br>
			<p>
				Visible Light Communication enables data transmission using LEDs for shorter distances. It has found its applications in indoor environments. 
				Visible Light Communication has found its place mainly to overcome the limitations
				of RF Spectrum, VLC is cheaper to implement and also, this technology
				can change the thought of not wasting light (electricity) but using light
				for a purpose (data transmission in our case).
			<br></br>
			<ul>
				<li>Street lights can transmit information to a vehicle if there is an accident further along the road 
				or the GPS co-ordinates of the location.</li>
				<li>Lights in colleges can transmit critical information to all the devices.</li>
				<li>Looking at the employability space, this new technology can provide work to people.</li>
				<li>The VLC can be used to transfer data from one mobile device to another with inherent security.</li>
			</ul>
			<br></br>
			For further implementation of our project, a communication link was established with researchers from New Jersey Institute of Technology and Boston University. M Rahaim and Sihua Shao helped us solve some of our queries regarding VLC Implementation.
